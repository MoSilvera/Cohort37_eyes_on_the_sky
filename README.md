# Sky Scanner

Sky Scanner is an app that utilizes three of NASA's open data API's to provide photos and information by user selected date

## Why Sky Scanner

As a teaching assistant at a coding bootcamp, I am always trying to keep my skills sharp, as well as create example code for my students. As our team explores ways to teach the use of custom events to our students, alongside the basics of asynchronous programming, I find it important to go through the experience my students are about to have.
This site is based on our *Eyes on the Sky* project.

## How to run Sky Scanner
1. Clone down the project to your computer. You can use the terminal command
     `git clone git@github.com:MoSilvera/Cohrot37_eyes_on_the_sky.git`

2. Make a directory at the root of the file called api
    `mkdir api`

3. Cd into that directory and make a file called database.json
    `cd api && touch database.json`
